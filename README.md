Use of Emojis in Tweets During 2016 USA Elections      
*Please see plots directory to see any ideological graphs. Currently the code gives you one graph combining both group.*

Project Discription
--------------------
This project contains a fairly big random sample of tweets which were made during 2016 USA election (presidential, house, senate, etc.). With this sample, I am making a network graph and doing term analysis of emoticons to comprehend whether emojis depicts the nature of extreminism.

*Confidential information such as the username, name and gender are hidden.*
**If you need to make an emoji dictionary or download each emojis as png pictures, you can use the script I've made. It is in the Scrape-Download-View directory above ;)**

OS
-----
Unix Based only! Windows doesn't render the emojis above 0xFFFF.
